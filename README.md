Team17-Engineering Copilot using LLMs augmented with Public and Proprietary Documentation

Abstract:
This paper presents a chat-bot application that is capable of answering engineering queries in the field of semiconductor devices. It is targeted as a replacement to traditional engineer-to-engineer interactions for addressing customer queries on specific Integrated Circuits (ICs) by referring to company proprietary documentation such as IC datasheets, application notes, and user manuals, as well as publicly available information. This application is to be built using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), software based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain framework. Performance comparisons of multiple RAG approaches will be published, along with those of commercially available tools of a test dataset of questions and answers.
